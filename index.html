					<!-- QUARTERLY -->
					<div class="lead"><a href="http://faculty.uw.edu/ajko">Andrew J. Ko, Ph.D.</a>, TA: <a href="mailto:franzrac@uw.com">Rachel Franz</a> and <a href="mailto:kimsk@uw.edu">Ada Kim</a></div>

					<p>In this class I'll teach you how to think like a designer. You'll learn what designers do, how they do it, and how to do some of the things they do. We'll focus on the design of user interfaces and information systems. By the end of the course you won't be a <i>great</i> designer, but you'll learn what you need to <i>practice</i> to become a great designer.</p>
				
					<p>The structure of this course is simple:</p>
	
					<ol>
						<li>I give you a pre-test to measure what you know about design.</li>
						<li>I teach you about design for 5 weeks through a series of readings and in-class practice.</li>
						<li>I give you the same pre-test as a midterm to see how much you learned.</li>
						<li>With a teammate, you design something useful for one of your classmates.</li>
						<li>With a teammate, you write a design specification that details your design thoroughly.</li>
						<li>With a teammate, you create a video prototype that communicates your design persuasively.</li>
					</ol>
										
					<p>Sound good? Let's get started!</p>
					
					<!-- QUARTERLY -->
					<h2>Office Hours</h2>
					
					<p>I'm available to talk about jobs, careers, graduate school, research, class, and anything else. My office hours this quarter are <b>After class Tuesday or Thursday or by appointment.</b>, though occasionally I need to schedule things over it. To guarantee I'll be around, write me in advance to secure a time.</p>

					<h2>Devices in Class</h2>
					
					<p>We will use smartphones and laptops throughout the quarter to facilitate activities and project work in-class. <b>However</b>, research and student feedback clearly shows that using devices on non-class related activities not only harms your own learning, but other students' learning as well. Therefore, I only allow device usage during activities that require devices. At all other times, you should not be using your device. I'll help you remember this by announcing when to bring devices out and when to put them away.</p>

					<p>Note that 70% of your grade is individual and 30% is team. If you do perfectly on the individual parts of the class and contribute nothing to the project, you can't pass the class. So be a good design partner!
	
					<div class="alert alert-danger">Late work receives no credit unless you can provide a note from a health care professional documenting the reason for your absence. However, you can miss up to 3 activities without penalty and without documentation. This should be enough to allow for sickness, unavoidable travel, or other personal matters. If you miss a reading quiz due to sickness, you can make up the quiz credit by sending a critique of the reading to me within a week of the due date that reports at least three improvements to the content, including high level issues such as topics that should be discussed or points you think are wrong, to low level issues including spelling, grammar, or clarity.</div>

					<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
					
					<p>Each day in class we'll practice some skill. You'll get <a href="#grading">1 point</a> if you engage in and complete the activity. How to get credit for the activity will depend on the activity; sometimes being present will be enough, sometimes being to class on time will be enough, and sometimes you'll have to turn something in.</p>
					
					<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
					
					<p>Readings are due twice a week, and each time, involve reading two things: 1) the chapter I wrote and 2) something related to the chapter I wrote, selected from links in my chapter, or from anything else in the world (but you have to find it).
					
					<p>The day that each reading is due, we'll do the following:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Anonymously share what you're confused about.</li>
						<li>I clarify confusions.</li>
						<li>I give you a question to answer individually about the assigned reading.</li>
						<li>You turn in your answer.</li>
						<li>You discuss your answer with your neighbor.</li>
						<li>We discuss the correct answer as a class.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Your answer is correct, you'll receive <a href="#grading">1 point</a>. I will give partial credit for partially correct answers, at my discretion.</p>
					
					<p>Your selected reading assignment is <i>your</i> choice. Before class, read <b>one</b> of the articles linked in the reading <b>or</b> choosing something design-related book, blog post, magazine article, newspaper article, or online video that that is relevant to the topic of the chapter. If you choose a book, it's okay to just read the first chapter of the book. For your additional 1 point of reading credit, submit to Canvas a summary of no more than 500 words that:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Summarizes the point of the article.</li>
						<li>Describes the thing you found most interesting about the article.</li>
						<li>Includes a citation to what you read.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In class, after we discuss the assigned reading, we will:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Break into groups of four</li>
						<li>Discuss your selected readings as a group, identifying one insight from the readings that connect with the topic of the day to share with the class</li>
						<li>Elect someone to share the insights with the class.</li>
						<li>We'll hear from 3-4 groups about their most interesting insight.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h2 id="midterm">Midterm</h2>
					
					<p>The midterm will be the same exam that I gave you on the first day of class. It will cover every topic in the assigned readings and every skill practiced in class. The midterm score will not be curved or scaled; however, any questions that more than 80% of students in the class get wrong will be excluded from the final score as they were likely confusing or concerned material that I poorly taught.</p>
	
					<h2 id="project">Project</h2>

					<p>This quarter, we'll be solving problems related to the theme:</p>
					
					<center><p style="font-size:xx-large;font-variant:small-caps">information diet</p></center>
					
					<p>Some examples of problems might be curbing Netflix additions, reading more politically balanced news, limiting use of social media during class, flagging fake news, or any number of other problems related to the information that people consume.</p>
					
					<p>For the project, you will form a team with <b>one</b> classmate and:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Pair up with another team</li>
						<li>Learn about a problem that one person in the other team has</li>
						<li>Articulate and refine your understanding of that classmate's problem</li>
						<li>Define a general characterization of that problem that many people have</li>
						<li>Become an <em>expert</em> on that problem through interviews and research</li>
						<li>Ideate solutions to the problem
						<li>Prototype solutions to the problem</li>
						<li>Detail one solution in the form of a design specification</li>
						<li>Communicate the solution as a video prototype.</li>
						<li>Evaluate the solution your classmates designed for you.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>This process has elements of human-centered design (in that it studies problems to inform design) and participatory design (in that you'll have a classmate who has the problem readily accessible for feedback and insight).</p>
										
					<p>What counts as good design? <b>Anything that actually addresses the problem your classmate has</b> is acceptable. As I've noted, I think <a href="readings/how-to-be-critical.html">good design is relative to values</a>, so make your values explicit, perhaps adopting the values that your classmate expresses about what would make a good design to them.</p>
					
					
					<h3>Prototypes</h3>
					
					<p>If you wish to quickly convey what your design does, try creating a <a href="http://www.storyboardthat.com">storyboard</a>. You can also use <a href="https://slickplan.com/">site mapping tools</a> to lay out the relationships between pages in a site or application.</p>

					<p>As part of creating the specification and video prototypes below, you'll need to create high-fidelity prototypes of your designs. If you're doing screen-based user interface design, I recommend using some combination the following tools, which are based on decades of HCI research on rapid prototyping:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a> or other diagramming tools to create medium-fidelity screens.</li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://prottapp.com/">Prott</a> or other similar tools for high-fidelity web, iOS, or Android designs</li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a> for its strong collaboration and workflow support</li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.axure.com/">Axure</a> for more interactive, data-driven prototypes</li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.moqups.com/">Moqup</a> for interactive prototypes</li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mockplus.com/">MockPlus</a> for interactive prototypes</li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.marvelapp.com/">Marvel</a> for simpler collaboration around static prototypes</li>
						<li><a target="_blank" href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> for lower-fidelity interactive prototypes.
					</ul>
					
					<p>There are also many simple, quick tools for making basic graphic design choices about <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/">fonts</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://color.adobe.com/explore/most-used/?time=all">colors</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://thenounproject.com/">icons</a>.
					
					<p>You shouldn't have to use advanced graphic design tools like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or Experience Design in this class. If you already know them, feel free to use them, but they have learning curves that are a bit too high to excel with them. That said, if you want a challenge, find someone who can tutor you and dive in!</p>

					<h3 id="project-specification">Specification</h3>
	
					<p>The point of a design specification is to document all of the <b>decisions</b> you've made about your design, from the high level details about the problem it is solving and how, to the low level details about fonts, colors, and layout. Your <b>audience</b> for a design specification is an <b>engineer</b> whose job it is to build your design. A great specification is unambiguous and carefully argued so that the engineer knows exactly what to make, doesn't have to do any design themselves, and doesn't decide to change any of your design choices.</p>
					
					<p>Your design specification must have the following sections:</p>
					<ul>
						<li id="project-problem"><b>Problem</b>. This section must be a sequence of paragraphs, each with a topic sentence, that 1) convinces a reader that a problem exists in the world, 2) teach them what causes it, and 3) isolates which cause you're going to address through design. In doing this, you must use the following forms of evidence to substantiate your claims about the problem:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>One or more research papers supporting claims about the problem.</li>
							<li>One or more existing designs that fail to address the problem.</li>
							<li>Evidence from your own user research</li>
						</ul>
						<li id="project-solution"><b>Solution</b>. This section must detail every:
							<ul>
								<li><b>Design decisions</b> necessary for engineering your solution, including every screen, every error, every algorithmic functionality, and every detail about the textual and visual content of your design (aside from content created by users). How much detail is enough? If your solution is software, a software engineer should be able to read your specification and build your solution without asking you any questions. This means providing two classes of specification: what information to <em>compute</em> (but not how) and what to information to <em>store</em> (but not how). For example, if you have an application that is going to compute a recommendation, you must specify exactly what kind of recommendations the system will compute with example data and data structures, but no details about algorithms for computing it.</li>
								<li><b>Design rationale</b> for every decision. This should be some form of justification for the major decisions in your design, ensuring that the engineer who builds it doesn't change your decision. This might come in the form of empirical evidence, a citation to a research paper, or a convincing argument.</li>
							</ul>
						<li id="project-evaluation"><b>Evaluation</b>. This section must present <b>empirical evidence</b> of the quality of your design. This might be an interview with an expert on the problem you studied, a series of interviews with representative users about the utility of the design, or a some other form of investigation about how well your solution addressed your problem.</li>
						<li id="project-limitations"><b>Limitations</b>. This section must detail all of the ways in which your design does <b>not</b> work, including who it doesn't work for, the situations it doesn't work in, and the assumptions it makes about how someone uses it for the design to effectively address the problem. A good limitations section is thorough and transparent, critically discussing the major ways in which the design can fail.</li>
						<li id="project-references"><b>References</b>. This section should include all scholarly publications and websites you cited in the main text of your specification.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Throughout, you should include annotated mockups of all of the screens in your design, where appropriate for clarity.</li>
					
					<p>Your specification must satisfy the following formatting constraints:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>8.5"x11" PDF</li>
						<li>1 inch margins</li>
						<li>Arial font</li>
						<li>11 pt for body and larger for headers.</li>
						<li>Figures and Tables must include numbered captions (e.g., Figure 6).</li>
						<li>The text should cite figures explicitly (e.g., "as Figure 6 shows...").</li> 
						<li>Single column.</li>
						<li>Single spaced.</li>
						<li>Cover page with names, group number, and optional name of design.</li> 
						<li>To ensure brevity, your entire document must be fewer than 2,500 words.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Write your specification in Google Docs. This simplifies obtaining feedback from peers and from the TA and I.</p>

					<h4>Examples</h4>

					<p>For guidance on content, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YdUNRxSo5az7W_KpLxiJ8dmi_HQdYoeCSBYrNYYOlCE/">see this example</a>. I wrote it to convey how you should structure and write your content, but it doesn't reflect the likely length and complexity of your document.</p>
					
					<p>Here's <a href="specification-exemplar.pdf">an exemplary specification</a> by a team from a previous quarter. It conveys the kind of content I expect, but followed a different format and didn't have a length requirement.</p>
					
					<h4 id="project-grading">Grading</h4>

					<p>Your specifications are worth <b>20 points</b>. <b>Five</b> of those points will be based on how well your design addresses the problem. The classmates that self-declare having the problem you solved will judge how well the solution addresses the problem for them, giving 5 points to designs that have a strong <em>potential</em> to address their problem, as defined, and 0 point to designs that have no promise of being effective. Your final score for this will be the <b>statistical mode</b> of the set of scores (the most frequent score among the set), where ties are broken by selecting the higher of the most frequent scores. If no one self-identifies having the problem you solved, you receive a <b>0</b>, as you solved a problem no one had.</p>
					
					<p>For the other <b>15 points</b>, we will grade your specifications by deducting a certain number of points for flaws that detract from the completeness, clarity, and convincing qualities of your specification (the words in caps are the shorthand we'll use in final grading):</p>
	
					<table class="table table-striped">
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>LOGIC</td><td>Illogical claim in problem statement.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>SUPPORT</td><td>Unsubstantiated claim.<br><em>Cite research, critique a design critique, or describe user research.</em></td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>PRIOR</td><td>Overlooked existing solution to problem.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>DETAIL</td><td>Missing detail that engineer would have to design.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>REASON</td><td>Missing or unconvincing rationale for a design detail.</tr>
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>CLAIM</td><td>Unsubstantiated claim in evaluation.</tr>
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>LIMITATION</td><td>Missing limitation in design.</tr>
						<tr><td>-0.5 points</td><td>AMBIGUITY</td><td>Ambiguous design detail.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.25 points</td><td>CLUTTER</td><td>Visual design clutter in mockup.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.25 points</td><td>TYPO</td><td>Spelling or grammar issues.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.25 points</td><td>REDUNDANT</td><td>Repetitive content.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.25 points</td><td>LAYOUT</td><td>Cluttered document formatting.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-0.25 points</td><td>FORMAT</td><td>Violation of a formatting rule.</td></tr>
					</table>
	
					<p>This will be a <b>team</b> grade. I expect your effort to be comparable, but your contributions to be complementary. If for some reason you feel that it should <b>not</b> be a team grade&mdash;because efforts were not comparable&mdash;you can write me a statement of 500 words or fewer providing background on why a team grade would not be fair. This statement is due at the same time as the specification and should be sent to me via email. If you submit such a statement, I will immediately reach out to your teammate for their response to your statement, to make sure that the grades we do assign accurately reflect contributions.</p>

					<h4 id="feedback">Feedback</h4>
					
					<p>Any design process, including the design of a document, requires feedback to achieve excellence. There are three ways you can get feedback on your design specification:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li><b>From peers in class</b>. Built in to the course are several opportunities to get feedback from your classmates.</li>
						<li><b>From me and the TA in class</b>. Ask me or the TA for feedback during open work time in class. There will be many times where you're working closely with your time during class time; find us, ask for feedback, and we'll provide it on the spot.</li>
						<li><b>From me and the TA over e-mail</b>. You can ask me and the TA for feedback <b>once</b> on each of the four individual sections of your specification. For example, you could write a draft of your problem definition, get feedback from the TA, revise it, then get feedback from me. That gives you at least two rounds of feedback before you submit your final specification. To request feedback, email a link to your specification Google Doc with commenting enabled and the TA or I will read the section you requested, providing detailed critique of the content. We'll do this within 20 business hours (counted as 9-5, Monday through Friday) of receiving the request to ensure you have time to revise your draft and get more feedback. Because of holidays and weekends, plan your requests carefully, since you might actually be waiting more than 2 days for our reply.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 id="project-video">Video</h3>
					
					<p>Video prototypes use the magic of editing to help someone else understand the problem you are solving and see how your solution would solve it.</p>
					
					<p>The video you upload must be:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>An MP4 file (to ensure we can play it).</li>
						<li>No longer than 3 minutes in length (to respect everyone's time).</li>
						<li>no higher than 480p resolution (to respect poor Canvas).</li>
					</ul>
										
					<p>Here's <a target="_blank" href="video-example.m4v">an example of a solid video prototype</a> that clearly conveys a problem and solution. Note that the prototype itself is not the focus; instead, the focus is on a person's problem and how the design helped them address their problem. Here's <a target="_blank" href="video-example2.m4v">another good example</a> that tells a clear story.</p>
					
					<p>I'll grade your team's video as follows:</p>
					
					<table class="table table-striped">
						<tr><td>2 points</td><td>Problem clarity</td><td>2 points for a problem that is concretely illustrated<br>1 point for a problem that is abstractly illustrated<br>0 points for a problem that is not illustrated at all</td></tr>
						<tr><td>2 points</td><td>Motive realism</td><td>Lose 0.5 points for each character action not plausibly motivated.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>2 points</td><td>Solution alignment</td><td>Lose 0.5 points for each misalignment between problem and solution.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>2 points</td><td>Seamless A/V</td><td>Lose 0.5 points for A/V details that disengages viewer</td></tr>
						<tr><td>2 points</td><td>Length</td><td>0 points for videos over 3 minutes in length.</td></tr>
					</table>
					
					<!--QUARTERLY-->
					<p>To inform the grade we choose, you'll fill out a peer evaluation survey, evaluating each of the videos submitted to class (including your own!). If you <em>don't</em> fill out the survey, you'll get 0 points for your video score. You'll have 48 hours after the video submission deadline to view and evaluate your classmates videos.</b>
					
					<p>This will be a <b>team grade</b>. I expect your effort to be comparable, but your contributions to be complementary. If for some reason you feel that it should <b>not</b> be a team grade&mdash;because efforts were not comparable&mdash;you can write me a statement of &lt;500 words or fewer providing background on why a team grade would not be fair. This statement is due at the same time as the video and should be sent to me via email. If you submit such a statement, I will immediately reach out to your teammate for their response to your statement, to make sure that the grades we do assign accurately reflect contributions.</p>
