		<h1>User testing</h1>

		<small>Requires: 3 8x11" sheets of paper for everyone plus pencil or pen</small>

		<h2>Make teams of three (5 min)</h2>
		
		<h2>Design an alarm clock (25 min)</h2>

		<p>Create an interactive, testable prototype of an alarm clock supports the following tasks:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Set the current 12-hour time in hours and minutes and confirm that it is correctly set.</li>
			<li>Set the 12-hour alarm time and confirm that it is set.</li>
			<li>Disable the alarm and confirm that it is not set.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><b>Your clock must be interactive and provide feedback!</b></p>
		<p>You will write your own descriptions for the above goals.</p>
			
		<h2>Write a user test protocol (15 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Include the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Thank your participant for participating</li>
			<li>Remind them that you're testing the design, not them</li>
			<li>Teach them how to think aloud</li>
			<li>Let them ask questions before they begin</li>
			<li>Have them attempt each task while thinking out loud; don't answer questions that would help directly with the goal</li>
			<li>Explain how to complete failed tasks, reassure them that its the design that failed, not them</li>		</ul>
			
		<p>Your script should contain the three tasks above.</p>
		
		<h2>Run multiple user tests (25 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Raise your hand to show participants that you're ready for a participant</li>
			<li>Two people stay behind and run the study</li>
			<li>One is the experimenter</li>
			<li>One writes down breakdowns that occur</li>
			<li>Everyone else on the team should look for teams holding up their hands</li>
			<li>Participate in two studies, then return to your group and swap with someone</li>
			<li>Wait at the front if no group is ready</li>
			<li>Everyone should participate in at least 2 studies</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Debrief (5 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What was most difficult about running these studies?</li>
			<li>Do you have clear insights about what caused breakdowns (or success)?</li>
			<li>What was the effect of your instructions on your participants' success?</li>
			<li>How would you change your design?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Credit (5 min)</h2>
	
		<p>Sign for credit.</h2>
