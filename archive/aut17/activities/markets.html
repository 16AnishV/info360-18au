		<h1>Designing in a marketplace</h1>
			
		<h2>A simulation</h2>

		<p>Today, we simulate an marketplace of design teams and users.</p>
		
		<p>You'll each be part of a 4 person team, including:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>A manager makes decisions for team</li>
			<li>a designer produces design ideas by talking to user</li>
			<li>An engineer produces widgets</li>
			<li>A marketer creates ads to sell widgets to user</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Choose your roles and choose a team name.</p>
		
		<p>The TA and I will be the <b>user</b>. We need widgets of a particular design, but I can't describe it, I only know it when I see it. The design is a <b>composition of lines</b>. You can only ask us yes or no questions about the design. The design I need does not change over time.</p>
			
		<p><b>Designers</b> designers design for user needs. They talk to the user to discover the needs. They deliver design ideas to their teams, verbally or otherwise. Designers can get up to 10 points, based on their teammate's rating of their work on a scale of 1 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied).</p>
			
		<p><b>Marketers</b> will be selling widgets to me through ads. I base my purchases on needs, desirability, and impulse. Marketers they create advertisements on notecards which describe the widget but do not show it. The user decides whether to buy the widget by reading the ad. Marketers get points equal to widgets sold Ð widgets remaining.</p>
		
		<p><b>Engineers</b> make widgets. When engineering a new widget, it takes them 3 minutes to conceive of the design. After that, they can create widgets, on notecards at a rate of 1 per minute, delivering them to the marketer. Engineers get 1 point for each widget created. Place your team name on every widget.</p>
		
		<p><b>Managers</b> make decisions for the team. No one on a team can act without the manager's permission. Managers get points equal to the points of their subordinate with the lowest score.</p>
		
		<p>We'll play for 45 minutes, then determine the winner and discuss why certain teams won or lost.</p>
		
		<h2>Credit</h2>
		
		<p>I'll circulate a sign in sheet for credit.</div>
