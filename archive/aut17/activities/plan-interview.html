		<h1>Plan your interview</h1>

		<p>The first step in your design process will be to interview the members of your sister team to discover problems in their lives that you can address through design.</p>
		
		<p>In the rest of class, you should plan your interview, probing into the hard problems in your classmates' lives. Your interview should include the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Establish rapport</b>. How will you get your informant comfortable sharing?</li>
			<li><b>Describe your goals</b>. Consent your informant into the purpose of the project and what you'd like to learn. Tell them how you'll be collecting data.</li>
			<li><b>Your interview questions</b>. What kinds of problems do you want to learn about? What can you ask to learn about them?</li>
			<li><b>Debrief</b>. Thank your participant and tell them how you'll be following up, if at all.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>All of the above details should be written down, in advance, to help structure your interview time. You must be ready to conduct your interview by lab time.</p>
