		<h1>Writing workshop</h1>

		<p>By now, you should have a clear idea and mockups of all of the screens for your idea. Today we'll work on <em>writing</em> about your idea, to help convey the behavior of your design in written form. Remember, the goal of your specification is to write the document to a level of detail that an engineer could take your description and build it without having to consult with you on any details.<p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Check out the <a href="../specification-example.pdf">example specification</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Create a shared Google Doc</b> with your teammate. This will be the draft of your design specification.</li>
			<li><b>Create an outline of your specification</b> following the guidelines in the project description.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Brainstorm what details are in and out of scope.</li>
				<li>How will you organize the description of your design?</li>
				<li>What kinds of diagrams or annotations will your mockups need to be clearly understood by your reader?</li>
				<li>Who is going to write what and by when?</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
				
		<h2>Credit</h2>
		
		<p>Show your outline and sign for credit.</p>
