		<h1>TA responsibilities</h1>

		<ul>
			<li><b>When</b> will you be away this quarter?</li>
			<li>Weekly teaching huddle to discuss flailing students, plans (<b>when</b>?)</li>
			<li>About our undergraduates: tech fluent, occasionally code-phobic</li>
			<li>Class learning objectives: design thinking skills</li>
			<li>Pedagogical approach and rationale: reading > lecturing, activities > exams</li>
			<li>One-time responsibilities</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Review</b> the syllabus for ambiguity (<strong>Abdullah</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Grade</b> the pre- and post test (<strong>Abdullah</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Report</b> midterm grades and pre-test grades to students with feedback about what they got wrong. (<strong>Abdullah</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Teach</b> when I'm away (<strong>Abdullah</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Critique</b> drafts of students' design specifications (<strong>Abdullah and Andy</strong>)</li>
				<li>Help final grading of specifications during finals week (<strong>Abdullah and Andy</strong>)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Carefully familiarize yourself with the rubric on the syllabus. I like to keep it open while grading so I can refer to the rules.</li>
					<li>I find it easiest to print the PDFs, rather than using a PDF annotation tool. It's just faster.</li>
					<li>When you see a violation, write the name of the violation from the rubric (e.g., SUPPORT, LOGIC, RATIONALE) and write a few words to convey why it's a violation. I'll use this to explain to students why they lost the points. (I make them come to my office if they want an explanation). You don't need to provide feedback like you did this past week.</li>
					<li>Use colored ink to make them easy to find.</li>
					<li>After finishing one, add up all the points they lost and put a total on the front.</li>
					<li>Make note of any violations you were unsure about and we'll discuss them on Friday.</li>
					<li>Bring the annotated printouts to the grading meeting as your ground truth.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Group grade final video prototypes during our grading marathon on Friday of finals (<b>when</b>?) (<strong>Abdullah and Andy</strong>)</li>
