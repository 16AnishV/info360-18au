		<h1>What do you want to do?</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Before we dive into design methods, I think it's important to reflect on how all of these skills and perspectives might be relevant to your goals. In this activity, you'll write some of your goals, discuss them with classmates, 

		<h2>Describe your possible self (10 min)</h2>

		<p>On a piece of paper, write me a description of your life in 5 years.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Where will you be?</li>
			<li>What will you be doing?</li>
			<li>What will be your job?</li>
			<li>What skills will you have?</li>
			<li>Where is this degree going to take you?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Think seriously about this. I want to know where you're headed so I can help you get there.</p>
		
		<h2>Share what you wrote with classmates (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Discuss in groups of two or three. Don't worry if your goals were vague or tentative. You'll probably find that others are too.</p>
		
		<h2>Let's discuss each role in depth (30 min)</h2>

		<p>For each role below, I'll explain the role, give some examples of the role in practice, and then ask you to take on the role for a 5-minute task with your group. Pretend you work for Netflix.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>User experience researchers</b>. Learn about problems in context.</li>

				<li>Interview as many classmates as you can about their movie and television viewing habits.</li>
			</ul>
