		<h1>Critique your problem definition</h1>

		<p>Take the draft problem statement that you write and do the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Have three classmates read your problem. Ask them to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Note every <b>logical flaw</b> in the argument.</li>
				<li>Note every <b>unsubstantiated claim</b> in the argument.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Have me or the TA read your statement and provide more feedback</p>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Refine your problem definition</h1>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What did you get wrong about your informant's problem? What do you have to fix?</li>
			<li>Is your problem small enough that you can address it with one design?</li>
			<li>Is your problem logically sound?</li>
			<li>Did you substantiate that your problem is real with evidence?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>When you have a problem description you like, <b>ask me or the TA for feedback</b> to get activity credit.</p>
			
		<h1>Ideate solutions</h2>
		
		<p>Once you feel like your problem statement is accurate and persuasive, start generating ideas for how to solve it.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Generate at least 10</b>. Find out what works and what doesn't.</li>
			<li><b>Select two to prototype</b> before the next class.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In planning your prototypes, think carefully about what you need to show your informant to evaluate the idea. What do they have to be able to see in order to imagine how the solution might impact their life? What can you make that would show this?</p>
