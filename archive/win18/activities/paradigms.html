		<h1>Comparing paradigms</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Today we're going to try to understand the difference between different design paradigms from an <i>experiential</i> perspective. How does it feel to <i>think</i> about a design problem from different perspectives? What are the different outcomes that different design processes lead to?</p>

		<h2>What to expect</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>This is going to feel ill-defined. That's normal. Remember, designers have to be good at designing design processes too, which means you'll be figuring out what to do with your time.</li>
			<li>These are artificially short periods of time to apply these methods. It's going to feel rushed in the same way it can feel rushed in industry.</li>
			<li>I don't want you to design anything in particular to solve these problems. That's for you to figure out as part of your design process.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Form groups (3 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Find <b>two</b> people you don't know in this class and team up with them.</p>
		
		<h3>1st paradigm: participatory design (25 min)</h3>

		<p>The problem: <em>how can undergraduates get more sleep?</em></p>

		<p>A <b>stakeholder</b> is anyone directly or indirectly affected by a problem.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Who are all of the stakeholders in this problem?</li>
			<li>How can you involve the stakeholders in the design process</li>
			<li>Study the problem by somehow involving stakeholders</li>
			<li>Ideate solutions with stakeholders</li>
			<li>Sketch a solution you believe best solves the problem for all stakeholders</li>
			<li>Test your solution with another group with different stakeholders</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Questions:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What affected the outcome of your design?</li>
			<li>How did stakeholders change your ideation?</li>
		</ul>
				
		<h3>2nd paradigm: value-sensitive design (25 min)</h3>

		<p>The problem: <em>how can we make college more affordable?</em></p>

		<p><b>Values</b> include ideas such as freedom, agency, privacy, security, independence, beauty, comfort, etc. Value-sensitive design engages these values to understand the nature of a problem from a values perspective.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Interview at least three different types of stakeholders</li>
			<li>What values are part of this problem?</li>
			<li>What are the tensions between the values in the problem?</li>
			<li>Ideate solutions that reconcile these different value tensions.</li>
			<li>Select a solution.</li>
			<li>Test your solution with another group with different stakeholders.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How was the focus on values different from the participatory approach?</li>
			<li>Did you find anything limiting about the value-sensitive approach?</li>
			<li>How were your solutions different from the participatory approach?</li>
		</ul>
