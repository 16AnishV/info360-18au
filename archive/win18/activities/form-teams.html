		<h1>Form teams</h1>

		<h2>Select one or two teammates (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Why two?</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Agility. You can move fast, schedule more easily, and will have fewer disagreements to resolve.</li>
			<li>No loafing. Both of you have to contribute because there's no one else.</li>
			<li>Learning. You'll learn more because you'll have to do more.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Why three?</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Resilience. If one of you is sick, two of you can still make progress.</li>
			<li>Diversity. The more perspectives, the better your design.</li>
			<li>Bandwidth. Less work, accomplish more.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>What factors should you consider in selecting?</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Are your skills complementary?</li>
			<li>Do you trust each other?</li>
			<li>Are your schedules compatible with regular meetings?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here's the process:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Spend 5 minutes discussing your skills and schedules with people in the class, trying to find a partner that's compatible.</li>
			<li>Make a final choice for partner</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Activity credit</h2>
		
		<p>Write your names and signatures next to each other for activity credit and to record your teams.</p>
