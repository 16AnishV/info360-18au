		<p>To design solutions, you must understand problems and to understand problems you must empathize.</p>
		
		<p>Don't believe me? Let's try something.</p>
		
		<p>Suppose you're trying to understand the experience of college students because you want to design solutions that make college easier to survive.</p>

		<h2>Brainstorm your problems (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>On a piece of paper, write down at least 5 things that you think makes college hard for <b>you</b>, and for each one, brainstorm a solution.</p>
		
		<h2>Brainstorm your classmates' problems (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Now, write down at least 5 things that you think makes college hard for your <b>classmates</b>. For each one, brainstorm a solution.</p>
		
		<h2>Uncover needs (10 min)</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Find one person in class you don't know.</li>
			<li>Share your list of things that make college difficult.</li>
			<li>Did they predict any of your problems?</li>
			<li>Would any of their solutions helped you? Why or why not?</li>
			<li>Now, it's your partner's turn.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Share (10 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What problems surprised you?</li>
			<li>Would any of your solutions have worked?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Visualize (10 min)</h2>
					
		<p>Let's write down all of the problems you encountered.</p>
		
		<p>Raise your hand if you have each one.</p>

		<p>Let's deconstruct the problems inside the problems. How could design one solution to solve all of those problems?</p>
		
		<h2>Credit</h2>
