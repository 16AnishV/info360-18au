		<p>To design solutions, you must understand problems and to understand problems you must empathize.</p>
		
		<p>Don't believe me? Let's try something.</p>
		
		<p>Suppose you're trying to understand the experience of college students because you want to design solutions that make college easier to survive.</p>

		<h2>Your problems (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>On a piece of paper:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2 min: write down at least 5 things that you think makes college hard for <b>you</b>;</li>
			<li>3 min: pick one problem and think of some solutions.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Others' problems (10 min)</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Find one person in class you don't know.</li>
			<li>Interview the person about their problems. (Try to get what are problems context.)</li>
			<li>Let yourself be interviewed.</li>
			<li>Pick one problem that you can both try to solve.</li>
			<li>Sketch up a couple of solutions for that problem?</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Share and compile (20 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What problems surprised you?</li>
			<li>What differed from your lonely exploration of problems to the interview one?</li>
			<li>What have you learned about other people that complement your views about your problems?</li>
			<li>What about the solutions: Any you want to share?</li>
			<li>How do you compare the solutions in the second round (together) to the ones in the first round?</li>
		</ul>
