		<h1>Defining problems</h1>

		<p>Design (and your final project in this class) regularly requires you to explain problems through argumentation. Today we'll practice how to form these arguments.</p>
		
		<h2>Choose a partner and a problem</h2>
		
		<p>Anyone is fine this time.</p>
		
		<p>Think of the problem in the world that bothers you both deeply, but is also a problem you have some expertise with.</p>

		<h2>Iteratively refine an argument that defines a problem (30 min)</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Brainstorm, dissect, and structure the <b>causality</b> of the problem based on your best knowledge of the problem. Conduct secondary research on the web to find other people's characterization of a problem and evidence to support these characterizations.</li>
			<li>In a text editor, devise a bulleted list of claims that specify the problem, going from broad to narrow, and ending with a design question. For example:</li>
			<ul>	
				<li>Most humans find kitties cute. [Evidence...]</li>
				<li>Cute things make people smile.  [Evidence...]</li>
				<li>Smiling makes people happy even when they're sad. [Evidence...]</li>
				<li>If there were a way humans could see kitties whenever they were sad, most humans could be happy [Evidence...]</li>
				<li>How can we empower humans to see kitties whenever they want?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Take the time to draft your argument, read it, revise it, and repeat until you feel like it's logical, persuasive, and valid.</li>
			<li>When you're ready for feedback, find another pair to get feedback from:</li>		
			<ul>
				<li>Was the argument logical? Or did some of the statements not follow logically?</li>
				<li>Do you believe the claims the argument was making?</li>
				<li>Does the argument convince you that the problem is real and exists?</li>
				<li>Does the argument convey the <i>causality</i> behind the problem?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Take the feedback you received, return to your seat, and improve the argument. When you think you're ready again, return to step 4 above.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Pitch (30 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Let's see how many we can hear before class ends!</p>

		<h2>Credit (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Submit your final argument through Canvas (<b>activity 2.3</b>).</p>
