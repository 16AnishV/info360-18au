		<h1>Creativity and context</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko & Nigini Oliveira</div>

		<h2>How can The Information School raise awareness of it's existence?</h2>
		
		<p>Our faculty, student, and staff space in Mary Gates and other buildings are invisible.</p>
		
		<h3>Pair up and ideate in isolation (5 min)</h3>

		<p>Find a partner and ideate solutions to this problem using your knowledge and memory.</p>		

		<h3>Ideate in context (20 min)</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Navigate the building and the grounds</li>
			<li>Observe it's structure, talk to its inhabitants, and use your surroundings to generate as many ideas as possible.</li>
			<li>Return in 20 minutes and we'll reflect on how this affected your ideation.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Synthesize (15 min)</h3>
		
		<p>(10 min) Form groups of 3 or 4 and discuss your insights and ideas.</p> 

		<p>(5 min) Combine design idea in as many design ideas as possible.</p>

		<h3>Brainstorm (15 min)</h3>

		<p>When compared to individual ideation, brainstorming is not a very productive form of idea generation because of:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Fear of critique</li>
			<li>Social loafing (assuming others will do the work), and </li>
			<li>Production blocking (only one person can talk at a time)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To get around these, there are brainstorming rules:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Focus on quantity</li>
			<li>Withhold criticism</li>
			<li>Unusual ideas are welcome</li>
			<li>Combine and improve ideas</li>
			<li>Elect a notetaker</li>
			<li>Write your own ideas while others are talking</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We will go around the class and each person will be able to propose a new idea or will be able to build on an already posed idea (that and...)</p>

		<h3>Discuss (10 min)</h3>
		
		<p>What effect did being in context have on your ideation?</p>
		<p>What did it feel like to brainstorm relative to our earlier ideation?</p>

		<h3>Credit (5min)</h3>
		
		<p>Sign the activity sheet for credit.</div>
