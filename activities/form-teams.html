		<h1>Form teams</h1>

		<h2>Select a teammate (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Why two?</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Agility. You can move fast, schedule more easily, and will have fewer disagreements.</li>
			<li>No loafing. Both of you have to contribute because there's no one else.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>(There will be one team of three. That's okay).</p>
		
		<p>What factors should you consider in selecting?</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Are your skills complementary?</li>
			<li>Do you trust each other?</li>
			<li>Are your schedules compatible with regular meetings?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here's the process:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Spend 5 minutes discussing your skills and schedules with people in the class, trying to find a partner that's compatible.</li>
			<li>Make a final choice for partner</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Activity credit</h2>
		
		<p>Write your names and signatures next to each other for activity credit and to record your teams.</p>

		<h2>Select a "sister" team</h2>
		
		<p>You're going to solve the problem of <b>one specific individual</b> in this class. To decide who that is, you'll choose another team to pair up with and you'll learn about the problems that each of the individuals in that team has. You'll choose one of those problems and attempt to address it through design.</p>
		
		<p>This is a variant on participatory design, since you'll have close access to a representative user of your design throughout the class. But that also means you can't hide bad designs: you'll have someone who will be highly skeptical of your solutions and you'll need to meet their high standards.</p>
