		<h1>Brainstorming</h1>

		<p>You've probably brainstormed before. But do you know the brainstorming rules? Today we'll practice them, and reflect on the relative differences between brainstorming and other types of ideation.</p>

		<h2>What is it? (5 min)</h2>

		<p>When compared to individual ideation, brainstorming is not a very productive form of idea generation because of:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Fear of critique</li>
			<li>Social loafing (assuming others will do the work), and </li>
			<li>Production blocking (only one person can talk at a time)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To get around these, there are brainstorming rules:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Focus on quantity</li>
			<li>Withhold criticism</li>
			<li>Unusual ideas are welcome</li>
			<li>Combine and improve ideas</li>
			<li>Elect a notetaker</li>
			<li>Write your own ideas while others are talking</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h2>Brainstorm (20 min)</h2>

		<p>Find a group of three. Try to generate at least <b>50 ideas</b> on a piece of paper. We'll generate the problem to brainstorm on in class.</p>
		
		<h2>Critique (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>As a group, discuss which of the ideas are most feasible to create and most <em>profitable</em> to build (from a business perspective). Choose one to share with the class.</p>
		
		<h2>Share! (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>What did you come up with?</p>
		
		<h2>Reflection (5 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What did it feel like to brainstorm relative to our earlier ideation?</li>
			<li>What was missing because you lacked context?</li>
			<li>What was difficult about brainstorming?</li>
			<li>Who loafed and why?</li>
		</ul>
