		<h1>Sketching</h1>

		<h2>Creative confidence (1 min)</h2>

		<p>Remember, creativity requires confidence. You may not be able to <i>illustrate</i>, but you can <i>sketch</i>. They're two different things. Illustration seeks to render reality, the other seeks to capture the essence of something's form and function.</p>
		
		<p>Throughout this activity, we'll practice the foundations of sketches in the domain of user interface prototyping, then start assembling these foundations into full sketches.</p>

		<h2>Lines (5 min)</h2>

		<p>Lines are the building blocks of sketches. Draw straight lines of varying lengths and orientations.</p>

		<h2>Rectangles (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Rectangles can convey containment and are the basis for wireframes. Use lines to compose rectangles of various sizes and orientations.</p>

		<h2>Labeled rectangles (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Compose rectangles with labels and text inside, outside, around. Labeled rectangles are the basis for most user interface elements.</p>
		
		<h2>Wireframe (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Combine boxes, labels, and lines to create a wireframe of a user interface of your choice. Find a user interface on your mobile device and replicate it as a sketched wireframe.</p>

		<p>Show it to your neighbors. Test whether they can tell you what everything is in your sketch.</p>

		<h2>3-dimensional objects (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Choose an object in the room and attempt to capture its essence in a simple sketch. It doesn't need to be realistic, it just needs to convey the identity of the object.</p>
		
		<p>Show your sketch of your object to a neighbors. Can they recognize what it is?</p>

		<h2>Humans (7 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Prototypes often need to convey context, showing how a human interacts with an idea. Sketch humans doing <b>three stereotypical activities</b>.</p>
		
		<p>Can your neighbors identify the activities?</p>
		
		<h2>Sketch a human using an interface (7 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Select a human interacting with a screen-based user interface of some kind. Show enough detail about the interaction that someone can know what the activity is and how they're engaging with the user interface.</p>

		<p>Can your classmates identify the activity?</p>

		<h2>Debrief</h2>
		
		<p>Sketching is about communication. If people knew what you had sketched, you succeeded!

		<h2>Credit</h2>
		
		<p>Submit your final sketch with your name on it.</div>
