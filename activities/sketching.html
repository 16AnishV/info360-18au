		<h1>Sketching</h1>
		<div class="lead">Nigini Oliveira & Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<h2>Creative confidence</h2>

		<p>Remember, creativity requires confidence. You may not be able to <i>illustrate</i>, but you can <i>sketch</i>. They're two different things. Illustration seeks to render reality, the other seeks to capture the essence of something's form and function.</p>
		
		<p>Throughout this activity, we'll practice the foundations of sketches in the domain of user interface prototyping, then start assembling these foundations into full sketches.</p>

		<h2>Lines, Rectangles & Text (10 min)</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Lines are the building blocks of sketches.</li>
			<li>Rectangles can convey containment and are the basis for wireframes. Use lines to compose rectangles of various sizes and orientations.</li>
			<li>Compose rectangles with labels and text inside, outside, around. Labeled rectangles are the basis for most user interface elements.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Task: Think about something that makes you happy and write it down on the paper you will submit for participation points. Now, use straight lines, rectangles and text of varying lengths and orientations to communicate that thing. (You can use inspiration from the web!)</p>
				
		<h2>Wireframe (15 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Step 1: Combine boxes, labels, and lines to create a wireframe of a user interface of your choice. Pick a user interface on your mobile device that you use often and replicate it as a sketched wireframe.</p>

		<p>Step 2: Now pick a thing you would change/add on that user interface to make it more useful to you.</p>

		<p>Step 3: Show it to your neighbors. Test whether they can tell you what everything is in your sketch.</p>

		<h2>Storyboard (15 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Step 1: Pick an app on your phone that have helped you a lot these days, and write down why this is the case.</p>

		<p>Step 2: Write down a second sentence that describes how the app works to help you.</p>

		<p>Step 3: Finally, how do you feel when you get this interaction done? (Does this involve other people or a place?)</p>

		<p>Step 4: Now draw a set a at least three simple sketches that tell that story (just like a comic strip).</p>

		<p>Step 5: Ask a classmate if they can understand it? If not, try to discover what is missing.</p>

		<h2>Debrief</h2>
		
		<p>Sketching is about communication. If people understood what you had sketched, you succeeded!

		<h2>Credit</h2>
		
		<p>Submit your final sketches with your name on it.</div>
