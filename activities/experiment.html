		<h1>Experiments</h1>

		<small>Requires: two pieces of paper and a pen</small>

		<p>Today we're going to run an experiment (known as an A/B test in industry).</p>

		<h2>Break into groups (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>To do this, we need to split up into two groups: <em>experimenters</em> and <em>participants</em>. If your birth date is a multiple of two, you're an experimenter. Otherwise, you're a participant.</p>

		<p>If the number of your <b>birth month</b> is even, you're in the <b>A group</b>, otherwise you're in the <b>B group</b>. The experimenters are going to design two different signs that try to achieve the same goal. The only information you'll receive about your goal will be on the sign. Please leave until we call you back in. It'll only be a few minutes.</p>
		
		<h2>Select a goal and design a sign (5 min)</h2>

		<p>As a group, let's decide what the objective should be. What should each group do that we can time?</p>

		<p>Experimenters, split up into groups A and B. You'll each devise a sign that attempts to arrange participants in each group into a particular pattern. You must convey this to them with no more than an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper. A, you must use a drawing and B, you must use words. We're going to find out which one is more effective, where effective is defined as the <b>time to complete</b>.</p>
		
		<h2>Run the experiment (10 min)</h2>
		
		<p>We'll call group A first, and after they've achieved their goal, they'll sit. We'll then call in group B.</p>

		<h2>Repeat (20 min)</h2>

		<p>Experimenters become participants, participants become experimenters and we repeat the above</p>
		
		<h2>Reflection (5 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What affected the validity of the experiment's results?</li>
			<li>Do you think the results generalize to other settings?</li>
			<li>How much information did you get from the experiment?</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2>Sign for Credit (3 min)</h2>
