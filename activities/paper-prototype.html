		<h1>Paper prototypes</h1>

		<small>Requires: paper, pencil or pen</small>

		<p>Paper prototyping is fast, allowing you to rapidly devise and refine user interface designs, even while you're testing them. Let's practice making some, while leveraging our new user interface design skills.</p>

		<h2>Pair up (5 min)</h2>
		
		<h2>Design and prototype (45 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Design the user interface for a simple consumer appliance (other than an alarm clock) such as microwave, dishwasher, washing machine, etc. Your goal is to <b>test the learnability of your design</b>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Determine the states, inputs, outputs, and event handlers (at least two)</li>
			<li>Create a wireframe paper prototype for a user interface that exposes these states, inputs, outputs, and event handlers.</li>
			<li>Create multiple sketches to convey the response of <i>every input</i> possible.</li>
			<li>Refine your prototype until you believe someone could learn to operate your prototype without aid.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Test (15 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Partner with another pair and see if they can learn how to use prototype correctly, <b>without your assistance</b>.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Prompt the other team to explore the interface's functionality.</li>
			<li>Use your wireframes to provide feedback for every input they provide, acting as the computer.</li>
			<li>Can they accurately explain, without assistance, the behavior of your design?</li>
			<li>What aspects of the design are ambiguous?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Reflect (10 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What was difficult about devising states, inputs, outputs, and event handlers?</li>
			<li>What was difficult about constructing a paper prototype?</li>
			<li>Were your prototypes clear?</li>
		</ul>
