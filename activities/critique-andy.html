		<h1>Critique</h1>
		
		<small>Materials: 1 piece of paper for each team for critique notes</small>

		<h2>Find your partner (1 min)</h2>

		<p>Open your InVision prototype, or your paper prototype if you don't have one.</p>

		<h2>Find two pairs to join (3 min)</h2>
		
		<p>You'll each critique each other group's design.</p>

		<h2>Critique designs (30 min)</h2>

		<p>Take 10 minutes each to critique each pair's design. <strong>You must use all 10 minutes; I'll tell you when to switch.</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Ask every question you can think of about every detail, uncovering rationale.</li>
			<li>If you're making a judgement, use the hamburger method.</li>
			<li>Keep notes on the critiques to practice capturing critiques while listening.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Reflection (10 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What was difficult about giving critique?</li>
			<li>What was difficult about receiving critique?</li>
			<li>Were there things you feel you could not say during critique?</li>
			<li>What are the limitations of this method of evaluation?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Plan revisions (10 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Now that you have feedback on your designs, <b>synthesize</b> it into a <b>written</b> plan with your partner.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What will you change about your design?</li>
			<li>What will you <em>not</em> change about your design?</li>
			<li>What questions do you still have about your design that demand more insight?</li>
			<li>What prototype could you create to answer these questions and how would you use the prototype to answer them?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Critique plans (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Describe your plans to the class. Let's deconstruct what's good about your plan and what could be better.</p>
		
		<h2>Credit (3 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Sign the activity sheet for credit.</p>
