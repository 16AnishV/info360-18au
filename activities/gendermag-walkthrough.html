		<h1>GenderMag walkthrough</h1>

		<p>A full draft of your solution description is due next week. Before finalizing your design, let's verify both it's usability and inclusiveness with <a href="walkthroughs.html">a GenderMag walkthrough</a>.</p>

		<h2>Plan your evaluation</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Pick a persona (e.g. <a href="http://gendermag.org/downloadables/Editable-Personas+Forms/CustomizablePersonas/AbbyPersona-electronicallyCustomizable.pdf">Abby</a>)</li>
			<li>Pick a task in your user interface to walk through</li>
			<li>Determine the intended sequence of subgoals and actions to achieve that ask in the interface.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Write your task, subgoals, and actions in a shared Google Doc.</p>
		
		<h2>Run your walkthrough</h2>

		<ol>		
			<li>Pick the next subgoal for that scenario (e.g. "See bookstore map"), then answer these questions:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby have formed this subgoal is part of her overall goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's motivations and strategies.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Pick an action for that subgoal (e.g. "Tap 'Browse Off'"), then answer the questions for that action.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby know what to do at this step?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's knowledge, skills, motivations, strategies, and self-efficacy.</li>
				<li>If Abby does the right thing, will she know she's making progress toward her goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's self-efficacy and attitudes toward risk.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Return to step 2 unless you've done enough actions to complete your subgoal</li>
			<li>Return to step 1 unless you've done enough subgoals to complete the task</li>
		</ol>

		<p>For each action and subgoal, copy the questions above, and answer them in your Google Doc.</p>

		<h2>Redesign</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li>What should change about your mockups? Write a change list in your Google Doc.</li>
			<li>What rationale should you capture to justify your final design?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Submit your results</h2>

		<p>Export a PDF of your results and email them to the instructor for credit. Make sure everyone's name is on the PDF.</p>
