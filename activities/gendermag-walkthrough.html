		<h1>GenderMag walkthrough</h1>

		<p>A full draft of your solution description is due in one week. Before finalizing your design, let's verify both it's usability and inclusiveness with <a href="walkthroughs.html">a GenderMag walkthrough</a>.</p>

		<h2>Evaluate (~60 minutes)</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Open a shared Google Doc and make sure you and your teammate both have access to it.</li>
			<li>In your document, note which persona you used. (Use <a href="http://gendermag.org/downloadables/Editable-Personas+Forms/CustomizablePersonas/AbbyPersona-electronicallyCustomizable.pdf">Abby</a>)</li>
			<li>Pick a task in your user interface to analyze and describe it in your document.</li>
			<li>Describe the sequence of subgoals and actions to achieve that ask in the interface. Remember, subgoals are <em>in the user's head</em>, actions are <em>in the world</em>.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Run the walkthrough:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>In your document, write the next subgoal for that task (e.g. "See bookstore map"), then answer these questions:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby have formed this subgoal is part of her overall goal? (Write your answer in the document)</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's motivations and strategies. (Write your answer in the document)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>In your document, write the next action for the current subgoal (e.g. "Tap 'Browse Off'"), then answer the questions for that action.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby know what to do at this step? (Write your answer in the document)</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's knowledge, skills, motivations, strategies, and self-efficacy. (Write your answer in the document)</li>
				<li>If Abby does the right thing, will she know she's making progress toward her goal? (Write your answer in the document)</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's self-efficacy and attitudes toward risk. (Write your answer in the document)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Return to step 2 unless you've done enough actions to complete the current subgoal.</li>
			<li>Return to step 1 unless you've done enough subgoals to complete the task</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><strong>Remember</strong>: stick to your subgoal and action sequences, regardless of whether or not the persona would actually do the steps. Assume the persona does the step correctly and continue through the walkthrough.</p>

		<h2>Reflect (~30 min)</h2>

		<p>In your Google Doc, answer the following questions, individually (you can write them in the same document):</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Do you feel that the issues you identified are meaningful to your design process?</li>
			<li>What changes will you make to your design? Explain your rationale for each change based on your walkthrough results.</li>
			<li>If a friend or coworker asked you "What is GenderMag?", how would you describe it to them?</li>
			<li>In future design projects (e.g., capstone, internships, jobs), would you use GenderMag to evaluate your design? Why and why not?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Export a PDF of your walkthrough document and submit to Canvas activity 8.1 for credit.</p>

		<h2>Plan (~20 min)</h2>
				
		<p>When you're done with the walkthrough, plan the next week. A draft of your solution description is due at the beginning of class next week. Who will revise the screens? What will the outline of your description be? Who will write what and by when?</p>
