		<h1>Walkthroughs</h1>

		<small>Requires: printouts of <a href="http://gendermag.org/downloadables/Editable-Personas+Forms/CustomizablePersonas/AbbyPersona-electronicallyCustomizable.pdf">Abby persona</a>, <a href="../assets/DeadBirdScenarioForms.docx">walkthrough forms</a></small>

		<p>Today we're going to practice conducting a GenderMag walkthrough to identify gender inclusiveness issues in a user interface.</p>

		<h2>The process (3 min)</h2>

		<p>This is reminder from the reading about how to conduct a GenderMag walkthrough:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Pick a persona (e.g. Abby)</li>
			<li>Pick a task in your user interface to walk through</li>
			<li>Determine the intended sequence of subgoals and actions to achieve that ask in the interface.</li>
			<li>Pick a subgoal for that scenario, then answer these questions:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby have formed this subgoal is part of her overall goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's motivations and strategies.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Pick an action for that subgoal, then answer the questions for that action.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby know what to do at this step?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's knowledge, skills, motivations, strategies, and self-efficacy.</li>
				<li>If Abby does the right thing, will she know she's making progress toward her goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's self-efficacy and attitudes toward risk.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Return to step 5 unless you've done enough actions to complete your subgoal</li>
			<li>Return to step 4 unless you've done enough subgoals to complete the scenario</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The rules (3 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Following these rules during the walkthrough is key:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Stay true to the persona</strong>: The team is looking to fix issues the persona might find, so really channel the persona.</li>
			<li><strong>Debate the facets</strong>: focus your discussions on the facets of the persona, not the surface features of the persona.</li>
			<li><strong>Follow the intended sequence</strong>: The persona might do something that is not part of the pre-made sequence, but stick to the chosen sequence.</li>
			<li><strong>Answer every question</strong>: The team wants to gather as much information as they can, so don't leave anything out.</li>
			<li><strong>The team doesn't have to agree</strong>: But make sure the recorder writes down everyones comments.</li>
			<li><strong>Just find the issues</strong>: During the session is not the time to <em>fix</em> the issues. Just focus on critique, not on ideation.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These are common mistakes people make:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>"I" Methodology</strong>: Evaluators often drift from the persona and answer questions from their perspective. Be sure to use the personas name to stay true to the persona.</li>
			<li><strong>"Look ahead" problems</strong>: Taking the action before the persona would, giving more information than the persona actually has.</li>
			<li><strong>Confusing actions with subgoals</strong>: Subgoals are ideas in the head while actions are done with the hands.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Form groups of three (3 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Each group needs three people:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The facilitator</strong>: Leads the team through the walkthrough and keeps it on track. Can also help to enforce rules and prevent counterproductive work.</li>
			<li><strong>The recorder</strong>: Records the team's comments and results in the GenderMag forms.</li>
			<li><strong>The driver</strong>: The person who drives the prototype for the team.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p>Additionally, <strong>everyone</strong>: does the evaluation work described below.</p>
		
		<h2>Your user interface, subgoals, and actions (5 min)</h2>
	
		<p>You'll be analyzing the <a href="http://ischool.uw.edu">iSchool website</a> website.</p>

		<p>The task you'll be analyzing is <em>applying for freshman direct admission</em> to Informatics. The scenario is that a high school student heard about Informatics from a family friend and wants to learn what's required to apply as a freshman:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Subgoal: find the website about Informatics admissions</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Visit <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></li>
				<li>Type "Informatics admissions"</li>
				<li>Click the "Informatics Admissions" search result</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Subgoal: learn about what is required for freshman direct admissions</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Click "Freshman Direct Admission"</li>
				<li>Scroll to "How to Be Considered for Freshman Direct Admission"</li>
				<li>Click the "Office of Admissions' Freshman Checklist" link</li>
				<li>Click the "Admissions to Majors" link</li>
				<li>Click the "Direct to Majors" link</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		<h2>Execute (30 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Follow the GenderMag steps using the task, subgoals, and actions above. Record all of the answers to all of the questions, noting any answers that indicate problems.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>You'll use Abby.</li>
			<li>Refer to the subgoals above.</li>
			<li>Answer these questions about the next subgoal:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby have formed this subgoal is part of her overall goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's motivations and strategies.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Pick the next action for that subgoal, then answer the questions for that action.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby know what to do at this step?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's 1) knowledge, 2) skills, 3) motivations, 4) strategies, and 5) self-efficacy.</li>
				<li>If Abby does the right thing, will she know she's making progress toward her goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's self-efficacy and attitudes toward risk.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Return to step 4 unless you've done enough actions to complete your subgoal</li>
			<li>Return to step 3 unless you've done enough subgoals to complete the scenario</li>
		</ol>


		<h2>Submit your issues (5 min)</h2>

		<p>For credit, turn in the filled out forms for the walkthrough. Make sure it has everyone's names on it.</p>

		<h2>Reflection (10 min)</h2>
		
		<p>First, write down your reflections on the following individually.</li>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What issues did you find?</li>
			<li>Do you believe you found legitimate issues?</li>
			<li>Were there aspects of the method you did not understand?</li>
			<li>What was difficult about conducting the walkthrough?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Then, we'll discuss them as a class and turn them in.</p>
