		<h1>Walkthroughs</h1>

		<small>Requires: one laptop and three people</small>

		<p>Today we're going to practice conducting a GenderMag walkthrough to identify gender inclusiveness issues in a user interface.</p>

		<h2>The process (3 min)</h2>

		<p>This is reminder from the reading about how to conduct a GenderMag walkthrough:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Pick a persona (eg. Abby)</li>
			<li>Pick a task in your user interface to walk through</li>
			<li>Determine the ideal sequence of subgoals and actions to achieve that ask in the interface.</li>
			<li>Pick a subgoal for that scenario (eg. "See bookstore map"), then answer these questions:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby have formed this subgoal is part of her overall goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's motivations and strategies.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Pick an action for that subgoal (eg. "Tap 'Browse Off'"), then answer the questions for that action.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Would Abby know what to do at this step?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's knowledge, skills, motivations, strategies, and self-efficacy.</li>
				<li>If Abby does the right thing, will she know she's making progress toward her goal?</li>
				<li>Why? Consider Abby's self-efficacy and attitudes toward risk.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Return to step 5 unless you've done enough actions to complete your subgoal</li>
			<li>Return to step 4 unless you've done enough subgoals to complete the scenario</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The rules (3 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Following these rules during the walkthrough is key:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Stay true to the persona</strong>: The team is looking to fix issues the persona might find, so really channel the persona.</li>
			<li>Follow the "ideal" sequence</strong>: The persona might do something that is not part of the pre-made sequence, but stick to the chosen sequence.</li>
			<li><strong>Answer every question</strong>: The team wants to gather as much information as they can, so don't leave anything out.</li>
			<li><strong>The team doesn't have to agree</strong>: But make sure the recorder writes down everyones comments.</li>
			<li><strong>Just find the issues</strong>: During the session is not the time to fix the issues. Just focus on critique, not on ideation.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These are common mistakes people make:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>"I" Methodology</strong>: Evaluators often drift from the persona and answer questions from their perspective. Be sure to use the personas name to stay true to the persona.</li>
			<li><strong>"Look ahead" problems</strong>: Taking the action before the persona would, giving more information than the persona actually has.</li>
			<li><strong>Confusing actions with subgoals</strong>: Subgoals are ideas in the head while actions are done with the hands.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Form groups of three (3 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Each group needs three people:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The facilitator</strong>: Leads the team through the walkthrough and keeps it on track. Can also help to enforce rules and prevent counterproductive work.</li>
			<li><strong>The recorder</strong>: Records the team's comments and results in the GenderMag forms.</li>
			<li><strong>The driver</strong>: The person who drives the prototype for the team.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p>Additionally, <strong>everyone</strong>: does the evaluation work described below.</p>
		
		<h2>Your user interface, subgoals, and actions (5 min)</h2>
	
		<p>You'll be analyzing the <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov">King County Courthouse</a> website.</p>

		<p>The task you'll be analyzing is <em>reporting a dead bird</em>. The scenario is that Abby woke up and left her house one morning and found a dead bird on the sidewalk. She had heard something on the news about King County monitoring avian flu, and decided to try to report it to the county. Abby doesn't know this yet, but to achieve this task requires the following subgoals and actions:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Subgoal: find a way to contact the county</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Visit <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov">www.kingcounty.gov</a></li>
				<li>Hover over "How do I..."</li>
				<li>Click "More tasks"</li>
				<li>Click "Do more online"</li>
				<li>Click "Dead bird"</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Subgoal: report the dead bird</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Fill out name</li>
				<li>Fill out phone</li>
				<li>Fill out email</li>
				<li>Fill out county</li>
				<li>Fill out crossroads</li>
				<li>Fill out date of sighting</li>
				<li>Select number of birds</li>
				<li>Select species</li>
				<li>Select time of death</li>
				<li>Select condition</li>
				<li>Select cause of death</li>
				<li>Fill out captcha</li>
				<li>Submit report</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		<h2>Execute (30 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Follow the GenderMag steps using the task, subgoals, and actions above. Record all of the answers to all of the questions, noting any answers that indicate problems.</p>

		<h2>Send me the issues (5 min)</h2>

		<p>For credit, send me the answers to all of the questions you answered in your walkthrough. Make sure it has everyone's names on it.</p>

		<h2>Reflection (10 min)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What issues did you find?</li>
			<li>Do you believe you found legitimate issues?</li>
			<li>Were there aspects of the method you did not understand?</li>
			<li>What was difficult about conducting the walkthrough?</li>
		</ul>
