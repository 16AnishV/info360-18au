		<h1>What do you want to do?</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>
		<p><small>Requirements: many dry erase markers</small></p>

		<p>Before we dive into design methods, I think it's important to reflect on how all of these skills and perspectives might be relevant to your goals. In this activity, you'll write some of your goals, discuss them with classmates, 

		<h2>Describe your possible self (10 min)</h2>

		<p>On a piece of paper, write me a description of your life in 5 years.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Where will you be?</li>
			<li>What will you be doing?</li>
			<li>What will be your job?</li>
			<li>What skills will you have?</li>
			<li>Where is this degree going to take you?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Think seriously about this. I want to know where you're headed so I can help you get there.</p>
		
		<h2>Share what you wrote with two classmates (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Discuss in groups of three. Don't worry if your goals were vague or tentative. You'll probably find that others are too.</p>
		
		<h2>Let's discuss each role in depth (30 min)</h2>

		<p>For each role below, I'll explain the role, give some examples of the role in practice, and then ask you to take on the role for a 5-minute task with your group of three.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>User experience researchers</b>. What information problems do people have?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Study people's movie viewing habits <em>qualitatively</em>, understanding problems they have.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Data scientists</b>. What information problems do people have?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Study people's movie viewing habits <em>quantitatively</em>, understanding problems they have.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Product designers</b>. How can information meet a market need?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Study the market for products that solve the problems you found and identify an opportunity</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Interaction/UX designers</b>. How should people interact with information?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Design an experience that would address the problem for which you found an opportunity.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Graphic designers</b>. How should people perceive information?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Design the visual experience of your interaction design.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Software engineers</b>. How can we store, structure, compute, analyze, and predict information?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Design a software architecture that would implement your design.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
