		<h1>What do you want to do?</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko & Nigini Oliveira</div>

		<p>Before we dive into design methods, I think it's important to reflect on how all of these skills and perspectives might be relevant to your goals. In this activity, you'll write some of your goals and we will discuss them in class in light of design careers.</p> 

		<h2>Describe your possible self [Prepare for class!]</h2>

		<p>On a piece of paper, write me a description of your life in 5 years.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Where will you be?</li>
			<li>What will you be doing?</li>
			<li>What will be your job?</li>
			<li>What skills will you have?</li>
			<li>Where is this degree going to take you?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Think seriously about this. I want to know where you're headed so I can help you get there.</p>

		<span style="color: red"><p>Bring this to class as it will count for your activity points!</p></span>
